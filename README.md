Gauntlt demo with Docker recipe for building a container with various, representative attack tools and Gauntlt attack file examples.

My thanks to James Wickett for putting together a helpful, introductory DevSecOps testing course (this demo is based in large part on the companion lab) and to the authors of Agile Application Security (which helped to put everything in context).
