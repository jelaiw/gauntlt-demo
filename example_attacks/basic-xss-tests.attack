Feature: Look for cross-site scripting (XSS) using arachni against our site.

Background:
	Given "arachni" is installed
	And the following environment variables:
	| name | environment_variable_name |
	| target_hostname | TARGET_HOSTNAME |

Scenario: Perform a quick test for XSS and verify no issues on login page.
	When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
	"""
	arachni --checks=xss --scope-page-limit=1 http://<target_hostname>
	"""
	Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected"

Scenario: Perform a full test for XSS and verify no issues on login page.
	When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
	"""
	arachni --checks=xss* --scope-page-limit=1 http://<target_hostname>
	"""
	Then the output should contain "2 issues were detected"
