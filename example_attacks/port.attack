Feature: Check to make sure the right ports are open on target server.
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name       | value |
      | host       | scanme.nmap.org |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected ports.
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <host>
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      80/tcp\s+open
      """
