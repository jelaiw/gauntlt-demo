Feature: Fuzz for common deployment mistakes.

Background:
	Given "dirb" is installed
	And the following profile:
	| name | value |
	| hostname | http://scanme.nmap.org |
	| dirb_wordlists_path | Overwritten by $DIRB_WORDLISTS |

Scenario: Use dirb to enumerate webapp for test-related web directories (mistakenly deployed to prod).
	And the following profile:
	| name | value |
	| wordlist | vulns/tests.txt |
	When I launch a "dirb" attack with:
	"""
	dirb <hostname> <dirb_wordlists_path>/<wordlist> -wf
	"""
	Then the output should contain:
	"""
	FOUND: 0
	"""

Scenario: Use dirb to enumerate webapp for known IBM Websphere (vulnerable) mis-configurations.
	And the following profile:
	| name | value |
	| wordlist | vulns/websphere.txt |
	When I launch a "dirb" attack with:
	"""
	dirb <hostname> <dirb_wordlists_path>/<wordlist> -wf
	"""
	Then the output should contain:
	"""
	FOUND: 2
	"""
